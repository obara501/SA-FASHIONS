            <h2 class="head2">Harnessing your masculine energy</h2>
            <p>"Girls should never be afraid to be smart".Emma Watson encourages the girls. This type of fashion is very
              comfortable and the fashion sense is just everything. There are stereotypes around that those are "boys" clothes. Today I 
              want to encourage you to do you! These clothes are very comfortable and will suit anybody. Embrace your masculine
              energy freely!

            <h2>You go girl</h2>
            <p>This type of girl is fiercely feminine and has allowed to be herself to be feminine. Women should
              be their best version. The dress looks so good on the girl and thats a true definition of embracing
              feminine energy and being in her own feminine creative power. You are amazing! Wear whatever you want 
              and feel best in. Do not forget to love your skin and show some skin sometime.
